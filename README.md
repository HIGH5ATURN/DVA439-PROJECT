# Abstract:

Snow removal focuses on identifying snow-covered areas and restoring clean images without repairing traces. Unlike the regularity and semitransparency of rain, snow appears in various patterns and causes severe occlusion of the background. As a result, state-of-the-art snow removal methods typically require a large number of parameters. This paper introduces a lightweight yet highly efficient snow removal network called Laplace Mask Query Transformer (LMQFormer).  

First, a Laplace-VQVAE is proposed to generate a coarse mask as prior knowledge of snow. Rather than relying on predefined masks from datasets, this model aims to reduce both the information entropy of snow and the computational cost of recovery. Next, a Mask Query Transformer (MQFormer) is designed to remove snow using the coarse mask. This architecture employs two parallel encoders and a hybrid decoder to capture extensive snow features while maintaining a lightweight structure. Additionally, a Duplicated Mask Query Attention (DMQA) mechanism is introduced, converting the coarse mask into a specific number of queries that constrain the attention areas of MQFormer while reducing parameters.  

Experimental results on popular datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model, achieving state-of-the-art snow removal quality with significantly fewer parameters and the lowest running time.
